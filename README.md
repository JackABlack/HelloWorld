# HelloWorld
Android camera project

## Introduction
This is a android application aimed to run TensorFlow image recognization modles on mobile phone, to test their working efficiency and give quick report in real time on your phone screen.

## How to use
*This application works better on phones with SDK API Level21(Android 5.0)*
1. Download project and import all files into your Android Studio
2. Run dependency download
3. Create folder name *assets* under path *app/main/src*, and put your modles in it. Per requirment from Google, file name should not contain underscore.
4. make change on *app/src/main/res/menu* to make this app fits your own situation, then make change in *app/src/main/java/MainActivities.java* to change the behavior when clicking related buttons.
5. Test your app as your wish.


## Next step
if get vacant, I would  make it easier to adjust. like make modles more easier to remove or add.
